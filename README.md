### Wireup pin connections

## Pin connections

The pin assignment is not strict and every pin can be reconfigured to another one, but it is recommended to follow the pinout below so it would work with the unmodified code:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Pin</th>
        <th>GPIO</th>
        <th>Reference</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>OE</td>
        <td>13</td>
        <td rowspan="13"><image src="./images" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CLK</td>
        <td>14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>LAT</td>
        <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CH_A</td>
        <td>26</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CH_B</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
